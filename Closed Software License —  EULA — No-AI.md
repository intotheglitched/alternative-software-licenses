PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE LICENSE & EULA — ABSOLUTE NO-AI
Version: 2025-08-20

Copyright (c) <YEAR(S)> <AUTHOR/ORG>.
All rights reserved.

This End-User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal agreement between <AUTHOR/ORG> (“Licensor”) and the entity or person that installs, accesses, or uses the Software (“Licensee”). By installing, accessing, or using the Software, Licensee accepts this EULA.

1) DEFINITIONS
“Software” means the proprietary software, in object and/or source form, together with tools, scripts, assets and documentation delivered by Licensor (including updates provided under a separate written agreement, if any).
“Authorized Users” means Licensee’s employees and individual contractors under written confidentiality obligations, using the Software solely for Licensee’s internal business.
“Repository Content” means the repository hosting the Software (e.g., GitHub/GitLab) and all content within or attached to it, including source code, commit history, branches, tags, release artifacts, binaries, package registries, issues, pull/merge requests, comments, discussions, wiki pages, documentation, CI/CD configurations, and metadata.
“AI/ML System” means any system capable of training, fine-tuning, evaluating, embedding, inferring, code-completing, vectorizing or otherwise learning from inputs (e.g., LLMs, foundation models, Copilot-like tools).
“TDM” means text-and-data mining, crawling, scraping or similar automated ingestion for analytics or model building.

2) LICENSE GRANT (CLOSED / INTERNAL USE ONLY)
Subject to this EULA and timely payment of all agreed fees (if any), Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the Software only for Licensee’s internal business purposes, by Authorized Users, at the sites or environments described in the applicable order/statement of work. No distribution, resale, hosting for third parties, public offering or making available to the public is permitted.
Any access to or cloning of Repository Content is permitted solely as reasonably necessary to exercise the internal-use license under this EULA and remains subject to all restrictions herein; no publication or redistribution of Repository Content is allowed.

3) OWNERSHIP
The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor and its licensors retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights, except for the limited rights expressly granted in Section 2.

4) ABSOLUTE NO-AI / NO-TDM
(a) No AI/ML Use. Licensee shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) use the Software, any portion thereof, the Repository Content, or any outputs, logs, metadata or documentation to train, fine-tune, evaluate, infer, embed, vectorize, index, augment or otherwise operate any machine-learning (ML) or AI system, or to generate code/outputs via automated systems.
(b) No TDM / No Ingestion. Licensee shall not crawl, scrape, harvest, bulk-extract, or perform text-and-data mining (TDM) on the Software, the Repository Content or documentation; and shall not upload or expose them to code-assist services, telemetry, or cloud analysis tools that retain or learn from the content.
(c) Machine-Readable Reservation. Licensor reserves all TDM rights and prohibits automated access except as expressly permitted in writing.
(d) No Circumvention. Licensee shall not bypass, remove, disable or circumvent technical or contractual measures that enforce this Section 4.

5) ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS
Except as expressly allowed in Section 2 and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensee shall not:
(a) copy the Software (except reasonable backup), modify, adapt, translate or create derivative works;
(b) distribute, publish, disclose, sublicense, lend, rent, lease, time-share, provide as a service, or otherwise make the Software available to any third party;
(c) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software, except to the limited extent that applicable law expressly permits despite this restriction;
(d) remove or alter proprietary notices, watermarks, identifiers or license keys;
(e) use the Software for benchmarking or competitive analysis for publication without Licensor’s prior written consent;
(f) use the Software in violation of export, sanctions, data-protection or other laws.

6) CONFIDENTIALITY
Licensee shall treat the Software and other Confidential Information as confidential, using at least the same degree of care as for its own confidential information (and no less than reasonable care). Licensee shall use it only as permitted by this EULA and disclose it only to Authorized Users with a need to know under written confidentiality terms. Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly cease use and destroy or return Confidential Information, certifying destruction on request.

7) OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS (IF ANY)
The Software may include third-party components under their own licenses, which shall govern those components. Such licenses do not grant any rights to the proprietary parts nor override the NO-AI / NO-TDM obligations herein.

8) SUPPORT AND UPDATES
Licensor has no obligation to provide support, maintenance, updates, security patches, compatibility fixes or availability, unless expressly agreed in a separate written support agreement. Any assistance is discretionary and may be withdrawn at any time.

9) COMPLIANCE; AUDIT (LIGHTWEIGHT)
Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure compliance with this EULA. On fifteen (15) business days’ notice, no more than once per calendar year, Licensor may request a certification of compliance signed by an officer and may designate an independent auditor (bound by confidentiality) to verify compliance during normal business hours. If a material breach is found, Licensee shall reimburse reasonable audit costs.

10) WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR SECURE. LICENSEE ASSUMES ALL RISK AS TO USE AND PERFORMANCE. The Software is not designed for safety-critical uses (e.g., medical, aviation, nuclear, life support). If used in such contexts, Licensee must implement appropriate fail-safes and redundancies and bears all risk.

11) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; NOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS EULA OR THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF EUR 100 OR THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. Nothing herein excludes liability where such exclusion is prohibited by law (including willful misconduct or gross negligence where not waivable).

12) INDEMNITY
Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor and its affiliates from and against claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of: (i) Licensee’s or Authorized Users’ use of the Software; (ii) violation of this EULA (including Section 4 NO-AI / NO-TDM); or (iii) violation of law or third-party rights. Licensor may participate in the defense with counsel of its choice at Licensee’s expense.

13) TERM; TERMINATION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
This EULA starts upon first installation, access or use and continues until terminated. Licensor may terminate immediately upon Licensee’s breach. Licensee may terminate by ceasing use and destroying all copies. Upon termination, all rights end and Licensee must cease use and destroy or return all copies and Confidential Information. Breach of Section 4 causes irreparable harm; Licensor may seek injunctive or equitable relief in addition to other remedies.

14) EXPORT CONTROLS AND SANCTIONS
Licensee shall not use, export, re-export, transfer or distribute the Software in violation of applicable export control or sanctions laws and regulations. Licensee represents that it is not a prohibited party under such regimes.

15) GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM
This EULA is governed by the laws of Italy. The courts of <City/Province, Italy> have exclusive jurisdiction, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. If Licensee is a consumer, mandatory consumer protections of Licensee’s residence may apply.

16) MISCELLANEOUS
Entire agreement; no waiver unless in writing; severability; assignment by Licensee only with Licensor’s prior written consent; notices to <legal@your-domain> (email) and Licensee’s notice address on file; headings for convenience only; the English language version governs.
