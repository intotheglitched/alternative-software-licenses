<sub>I see companies using our developments without paying us, without giving us any credit or honor.</sub>
<sub>This now includes GitHub, which has moved to the AI branch, and (not official) GitLab.</sub>
<sub>If github don't change policy i try other services, like https://about.gitea.com/</sub>
<sub>Many people don't notice, but everything you do is being stolen without consent.</sub>
<sub>It's outright exploitation, where we are treated as “data for analysis” without seeing how much passion and hours of our lives are spent developing our libraries and frameworks (indie and otherwise).</sub>
<sub>It's unspeakable, someone has to do something... In the meantime, I propose these licenses.</sub>
<sub>Please note: the licenses are provided free of charge and without any legal responsibility regarding their use. Bring the texts to the attention of your lawyers and have them approve their use.</sub>
<sub>Feedback is welcome, follow or star.
