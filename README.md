### Current situation (20/08/2025):

During this period, I discovered that the only one with protection against scraping is <a href="https://codeberg.org/">codeberg</a> (which, however, does not accept non-FOSS products). All the others do NOT have ‚Äúinternal protection,‚Äù i.e., a privacy flag that opens the code only to those registered on the site as protection against indiscriminate scraping and even AI grabbing for machine learning.

‚ÄúPublic does not mean to be usurped.‚Äù

I‚Äôll set up the table with eight services and organize by columns:

üõ°Ô∏è Members-only/login wall for browsing "public" repos<br>
- Service
- Default exposure of public repos (anonymous scraping)
- Trains on hosted public code?
- Notes (Enterprise/self-host options)
- Sources

For the ‚ÄúMembers-only wall‚Äù column:<br>
- Codeberg: ‚úÖ ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù profile visibility, restricting access to logged-in users only.
- GitLab (SaaS): ‚ùå No internal wall on GitLab.com.
- GitLab (Self-Managed/Dedicated): ‚úÖ ‚ÄúInternal‚Äù visibility available.
- GitHub (github.com general): ‚ùå Only enterprise version offers ‚Äúinternal‚Äù repositories.

I'll include a note on Enterprise Cloud internal gating.<br>
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud: ‚úÖ internal repos available.
- Bitbucket Cloud: ‚ùå only public/private options.
- Azure DevOps Services: ‚ùå public accessible globally, no login wall.
- AWS CodeCommit: N/A, no public repos.
- Gitea.com: ‚ùå (self-hosted supports sign-in gating).
- SourceHut: ‚ùå no login wall but anti-ML in ToS.
- Scraping countermeasures: For example, Codeberg uses Anubis (bypassed).

Also, GitHub trains on hosted public code. GitLab does not.

cit github _By default, GitHub, its affiliates, and third parties will not use your data, including prompts, suggestions, and code snippets, for AI model training. This is reflected in your personal settings for GitHub Copilot and cannot be enabled. ([link](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/manage-policies?utm_source=chatgpt.com#model-training-and-improvements)_ But the CEO has resigned and [Microsoft is launching into AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/microsofts-github-chief-is-leaving-competition-ramps-up-in-ai-coding.html#:~:text=Microsoft's%20GitHub%20chief%20is%20leaving%20as%20competition%20ramps%20up%20in%20AI%20coding%20market&text=Thomas%20Dohmke%2C%20who%20has%20been,part%20of%20Microsoft's%20CoreAI%20group.). Among major forges, GitHub is the one that explicitly acknowledges training. on hosted public GitHub repos and doesn‚Äôt offer a repo-level ‚Äúdo not train‚Äù flag. On the hoder hands GitLab, Atlassian, Microsoft (Azure DevOps), AWS CodeCommit, Gitea, SourceHut, Codeberg: no evidence they train on your hosted public repos; several publish explicit no-training commitments or even ban ML scraping. 

You can limit github + copilot grabbing code in these ways:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%"><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intotheglitched/alternative-software-licenses/refs/heads/main/images/copilot.disabled.3.png></td>
<td width="33%"><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intotheglitched/alternative-software-licenses/refs/heads/main/images/copilot.not.disable.2.png></td>
<td width="33%"><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intotheglitched/alternative-software-licenses/refs/heads/main/images/copilot.not.disable.png></td>
</tr>
</table>

and it is easy to understand that it cannot be completely disabled (you cant).
However... **Those toggles only apply to Copilot's ‚Äúyour usage data‚Äù (prompts, suggestions, and small snippets you send/receive while using Copilot). They don't change the fact that Copilot's models were pre-trained on public code (including public GitHub repos). I was not asked for permission, I was not paid, and to me this is tantamount to data theft.**


Helpful legal note (EU): In the EU, the TDM exception in Art. 4 of the DSM Directive allows data mining unless there is an "appropriate" opt-out (including machine-readable data): <b>if you don't reserve the rights, your public content can be used for training - everywere</b>.
