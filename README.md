cit github _By default, GitHub, its affiliates, and third parties will not use your data, including prompts, suggestions, and code snippets, for AI model training. This is reflected in your personal settings for GitHub Copilot and cannot be enabled. ([link](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/manage-policies?utm_source=chatgpt.com#model-training-and-improvements)_ But the CEO has resigned and [Microsoft is launching into AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/microsofts-github-chief-is-leaving-competition-ramps-up-in-ai-coding.html#:~:text=Microsoft's%20GitHub%20chief%20is%20leaving%20as%20competition%20ramps%20up%20in%20AI%20coding%20market&text=Thomas%20Dohmke%2C%20who%20has%20been,part%20of%20Microsoft's%20CoreAI%20group.). Among major forges, GitHub is the one that explicitly acknowledges training. on hosted public GitHub repos and doesn’t offer a repo-level “do not train” flag. On the hoder hands GitLab, Atlassian, Microsoft (Azure DevOps), AWS CodeCommit, Gitea, SourceHut, Codeberg: no evidence they train on your hosted public repos; several publish explicit no-training commitments or even ban ML scraping. 

Helpful legal note (EU): In the EU, the TDM exception in Art. 4 of the DSM Directive allows data mining unless there is an "appropriate" opt-out (including machine-readable data): <b>if you don't reserve the rights, your public content can be used for training - everywere</b>. This is an evolving topic (debate on switching to opt-in). (cit: legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com, Morrison Foerster, PC Gamer)

<b>All your public code is shared for Ai without a licence</b>
